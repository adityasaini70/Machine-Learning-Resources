# Machine Learning Resources :mage:

This repository is a personal collection of some useful Machine Learning resources like blogs, articles, research papers, course reviews etc for easy reference. Useful PRs are appreciated!

## Topic wise notes
The following notes stem from the course ['Machine Learning'](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) organized by Prof. Andrew Ng, Stanford at Coursera. They can serve as a good refresher of some basic topics in Machine Learning, apart from being a helpful aid in the course. You can also check out a week-wise distribution of these notes and the assignments at this [link](https://github.com/adityasaini70/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Courses/Machine%20Learning%20-%20Andrew%20Ng).

# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
# Model Evaluation and Validation
Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
# Install
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

# Code
Template code is provided in the boston_housing.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included visuals.py Python file and the housing.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in visuals.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

# Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory boston_housing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
or open with Juoyter Lab

jupyter lab
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

# Data
The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Features

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
Target Variable 4. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes
